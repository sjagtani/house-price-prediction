\section{House Price Prediction}

\textbf{TLDR:} An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts house prices using the Ames Housing dataset, featuring interactive visualizations and real-time predictions.

\subsection{Project Overview}

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict house prices based on key features from the Ames Housing dataset. The application combines data analysis, feature engineering, and model development to create an interactive web tool for real estate price estimation.

\subsection{Key Features}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data Analysis Dashboard} with price distribution visualizations and correlation analysis
  \item \textbf{Real-time Price Prediction} interface with user-friendly controls
  \item \textbf{Model Performance Metrics} showing prediction accuracy and error analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Implementation}

\subsubsection{Data Analysis \& Feature Engineering}

The model leverages the most influential features identified through correlation analysis:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Overall Quality (strongest correlation, r = 0.795)
  \item Ground Living Area (r = 0.698)
  \item Garage Cars (r = 0.644)
  \item Total Basement SF (r = 0.612)
  \item Year Built (r = 0.545)
\end{itemize}

Key preprocessing steps included median imputation for missing values and log transformation of the target variable to address skewed distribution and non-linear relationships.

\subsubsection{Model Selection}

Three models were evaluated:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Model & RMSE & Notes \\
\hline
Linear Regression & \$41,826 & Good baseline but prone to overfitting \\
Ridge ($\alpha$=10) & \$40,442 & Better handling of multicollinearity \\
Lasso ($\alpha$=0.001) & \$40,352 & Selected as final model for best RMSE and feature selection \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The final Lasso model delivers predictions within 11.9\% of actual values (MAPE) with an R² of 0.744.

\subsection{Technologies Used}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Python 3.x with Pandas \& NumPy for data processing
  \item Scikit-learn for machine learning
  \item Plotly for interactive visualizations
  \item Streamlit for web application
  \item GitHub for version control
  \item Streamlit Cloud for deployment
\end{itemize}
